## Overview

This project demonstrates how to leverage KerasHub to load and run text generation tasks using a pre-trained GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). GPT-2 is an advanced language model created by OpenAI, known for generating contextually rich and coherent text. Using KerasHub, we simplify the process of loading the model, fine-tuning it if desired, and generating text based on user prompts.

## Features
•	Pre-trained GPT-2 Model: Load a GPT-2 model from KerasHub with ease, ready for text generation tasks.

•	Text Generation with Customization: Generate text with adjustable parameters for length, creativity, and sampling.

•	Fine-tuning Capability: Optional fine-tuning for tailoring the model to custom datasets.

## Introduction to Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning models that are trained on a large corpus of text data to generate outputs for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, question answering, and machine translation.

Generative LLMs are typically based on deep learning neural networks, such as the Transformer architecture invented by Google researchers in 2017, and are trained on massive amounts of text data, often involving billions of words. These models, such as Google LaMDA and PaLM, are trained with a large dataset from various data sources which allows them to generate output for many tasks. The core of Generative LLMs is predicting the next word in a sentence, often referred as Causal LM Pretraining. In this way LLMs can generate coherent text based on user prompts. For a more pedagogical discussion on language models, you can refer to the Stanford CS324 LLM class.

## Introduction to KerasHub
Large Language Models are complex to build and expensive to train from scratch. Luckily there are pretrained LLMs available for use right away. KerasHub provides a large number of pre-trained checkpoints that allow you to experiment with SOTA models without needing to train them yourself.

KerasHub is a natural language processing library that supports users through their entire development cycle. KerasHub offers both pretrained models and modularized building blocks, so developers could easily reuse pretrained models or stack their own LLM.
#### In a nutshell, for generative LLM, KerasHub offers:

•	Pretrained models with generate() method, e.g., **keras_hub.models.GPT2CausalLM** and **keras_hub.models.OPTCausalLM.**

•	Sampler class that implements generation algorithms such as Top-K, Beam and contrastive search. These samplers can be used to generate text with custom models.
